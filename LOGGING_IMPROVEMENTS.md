# Logging Improvements and Directory Creation Fix for Musai

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Uninformative Logging
The original logging message "Executing step 3/20" was not informative enough to understand what the agent was actually doing during execution.

### 2. Directory Creation Issue
The `file_operators` tool claimed it couldn't create directories, which prevented file creation in non-existent directory structures.

## Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Logging
Enhanced logging throughout the codebase to provide better context about agent execution, planning flow progress, and tool usage.

### 2. Directory Creation Support
Added comprehensive directory creation support to the `FileOperator` interface and implementations, ensuring files can be created in non-existent directory structures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Agent Step Logging (`app/agent/base.py`)

**Before:**
```
Executing step 3/20
```

**After:**
```
üîÑ [Musai] A versatile agent that can solve various tasks using multiple tools including MCP-based tools - Executing step 3/20 | Task: Create a simple Python script that prints 'Hello, World!'
```

**Improvements:**
- Added agent name and description context
- Included current task context from memory
- Added emoji for visual distinction
- Truncated long task descriptions for readability

### 2. Enhanced Planning Flow Logging (`app/flow/planning.py`)

**Before:**
```
Executing step 3/20
```

**After:**
```
üìã Planning Flow - Executing step 3: 'Create a data analysis script'
ü§ñ Using agent: [Musai] A versatile agent that can solve various tasks using multiple tools including MCP-based tools
üè∑Ô∏è Step type: code
üìä Plan Progress: 2/5 steps completed (40.0%)
```

**Improvements:**
- Added planning flow context
- Showed which agent is being used for each step
- Displayed step type/category
- Added progress tracking with percentages
- Enhanced plan creation logging

### 3. Enhanced Tool Execution Logging (`app/agent/toolcall.py`)

**Before:**
```
üîß Activating tool: 'python_execute'...
üéØ Tool 'python_execute' completed its mission! Result: [long result]
```

**After:**
```
üîß Activating tool: 'python_execute' with args: {'code': 'print("Hello, World!")'}
‚úÖ Tool 'python_execute' completed successfully! Result length: 45 chars
```

**Improvements:**
- Show tool arguments for better debugging
- Display result length instead of full result to avoid log spam
- Use success emoji for completed tools

### 4. Plan Creation Logging

**New:**
```
üéØ Creating execution plan for task: Create a data analysis script that reads a CSV file...
üìã Plan created successfully with 5 steps
```

### 5. Directory Creation Support (`app/tool/file_operators.py`)

**Added to FileOperator interface:**
```python
async def create_directory(self, path: PathLike, parents: bool = True) -> None:
    """Create a directory, optionally creating parent directories."""
    ...
```

**LocalFileOperator implementation:**
```python
async def create_directory(self, path: PathLike, parents: bool = True) -> None:
    """Create a directory locally, optionally creating parent directories."""
    try:
        Path(path).mkdir(parents=parents, exist_ok=True)
    except Exception as e:
        raise ToolError(f"Failed to create directory {path}: {str(e)}") from None
```

**SandboxFileOperator implementation:**
```python
async def create_directory(self, path: PathLike, parents: bool = True) -> None:
    """Create a directory in sandbox, optionally creating parent directories."""
    await self._ensure_sandbox_initialized()
    try:
        # Use mkdir with -p flag for creating parent directories if requested
        mkdir_cmd = f"mkdir -p {path}" if parents else f"mkdir {path}"
        result = await self.sandbox_client.run_command(mkdir_cmd)
        # Check if the command was successful by testing if directory exists
        if not await self.is_directory(path):
            raise ToolError(f"Failed to create directory {path} in sandbox")
    except Exception as e:
        raise ToolError(f"Failed to create directory {path} in sandbox: {str(e)}") from None
```

### 6. Enhanced File Creation (`app/tool/str_replace_editor.py`)

**Updated file creation to ensure parent directories exist:**
```python
# Ensure parent directory exists before creating the file
parent_dir = Path(path).parent
if parent_dir != Path(path).root:  # Don't try to create root directory
    await operator.create_directory(parent_dir, parents=True)

await operator.write_file(path, file_text)
```

## Benefits

### Logging Improvements
1. **Better Context**: Users can now see what agent is working on and what task it's trying to accomplish
2. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into plan progress and step completion
3. **Debugging**: Tool arguments and execution details help with troubleshooting
4. **Visual Clarity**: Emojis and structured formatting make logs easier to scan
5. **Reduced Noise**: Long results are summarized instead of dumped to logs

### Directory Creation Support
1. **Reliable File Creation**: Files can now be created in non-existent directory structures
2. **Automatic Directory Creation**: Parent directories are automatically created when needed
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works in both local and sandbox environments
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages when directory creation fails
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged

## Usage

The improved logging is automatically active when using any agent or planning flow. No configuration changes are required.

### Example Output

```

```

## Testing

### Logging Improvements
Run the test script to see the improvements in action:

```bash
python test_improved_logging.py
```

This will demonstrate both agent-level and planning flow-level logging improvements.

### Directory Creation Support
Run the directory creation test script:

```bash
python test_directory_creation.py
```

This will test directory creation in both local and sandbox environments, as well as verify that the StrReplaceEditor tool properly creates directories when needed.
