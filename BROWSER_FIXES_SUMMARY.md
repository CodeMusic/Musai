# üîß Browser Tool Infinite Retry Loop Fixes

## Problem Diagnosis

The browser tool was getting stuck in infinite retry loops when:
1. **URLs loaded successfully but contained error content** (soft 404s, "Page Not Found" messages)
2. **Pages appeared to load but had minimal/empty content** (JavaScript failed to load, blocked content)
3. **The tool kept taking screenshots and calling `get_current_state`** without validating if the page was useful

## Root Cause

The `go_to_url` action only checked for basic redirect patterns but didn't validate the actual content of the loaded page. This meant:
- ‚úÖ Navigation appeared successful (HTTP 200 response)
- ‚ùå Page contained error messages or empty content
- üîÑ Agent would retry extraction/interaction in an infinite loop

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Enhanced `go_to_url` Content Validation

Added comprehensive checks after navigation with smart whitelisting:

```python
# WHITELIST: Skip error detection for known good sites
trusted_domains = ["google.com/search", "bing.com/search", "wikipedia.org"]

if is_trusted_site:
    # For Google search, validate results specifically
    if "google.com/search" in final_url:
        has_search_results = page.querySelector('div#search, div#rso, div.g') !== null
        if has_search_results:
            return ToolResult(output="‚úÖ Successfully loaded Google search results")

# Check for problematic redirects (Google Tag Manager, etc.)
problematic_redirects = ["googletagmanager.com", "google-analytics.com"]

if is_problematic_redirect:
    return ToolResult(error="Redirect to tracking service detected")

# Smart error pattern detection (avoids false positives)
error_patterns = ["page not found", "404", "access denied", "forbidden"]

# More careful "not found" detection to avoid search result false positives
has_error_content = check_specific_error_contexts(content, patterns)

if has_error_content:
    return ToolResult(error="Page loaded but contains error content")
```

### 2. Enhanced `extract_content` Validation

Added defensive checks before attempting content extraction:

```python
# Check for insufficient content
if len(content.strip()) < 100:
    return ToolResult(
        error="Cannot extract content - page contains insufficient content. Do not retry extraction."
    )

# Check for error indicators in content
if any(indicator in content_lower for indicator in error_indicators):
    return ToolResult(
        error="Cannot extract content - page shows error content. Do not retry extraction."
    )
```

### 3. Enhanced `get_current_state` Protection

Added checks to avoid repeated screenshots of broken pages:

```python
# Avoid screenshots of problematic pages
if (current_url.startswith("about:") or "blank" in current_url.lower()
    or "error" in current_url.lower()):
    return ToolResult(
        error="Cannot get browser state - page is blank or shows an error."
    )
```

### 4. Smart Whitelisting for Trusted Sites

Added domain whitelisting to prevent false positives on legitimate sites:

```python
# Whitelist known good sites to avoid false error detection
trusted_domains = ["google.com/search", "bing.com/search", "wikipedia.org"]

# For Google search results, validate using DOM selectors
if "google.com/search" in url:
    has_search_results = document.querySelector('div#search, div#rso, div.g') !== null
    # Only return error if actually no results found, not on valid search pages
```

## Key Improvements

### ‚úÖ Prevents False Positives
- **Before**: Google search results flagged as "error content"
- **After**: Smart validation recognizes legitimate search result pages

### ‚úÖ Clear Error Messages
- **Before**: "Successfully navigated to URL" (even for broken pages)
- **After**: "‚ùå Page loaded but shows an error. Do not retry - the URL may be invalid."

### ‚úÖ Content Validation
- **Before**: No validation of page content after loading
- **After**: Checks visible text length, interactive elements, and error patterns

### ‚úÖ Explicit "Do Not Retry" Instructions
- **Before**: Generic error messages that didn't prevent retries
- **After**: Clear instructions like "Do not retry" and "consider alternative approaches"

### ‚úÖ Multiple Validation Layers
1. **Navigation level**: URL redirects and response validation
2. **Content level**: Text content and structure validation
3. **Interaction level**: Element availability and clickability
4. **State level**: Prevents screenshots of broken pages

## Expected Behavior Now

### For Valid Pages
```
‚úÖ Successfully navigated to https://example.com (final URL: https://example.com).
Page title: 'Example Site'. Content appears valid with 1247 chars of text and 23 interactive elements.
```

### For Error Pages
```
‚ùå Page at https://example.com/broken loaded but shows an error.
Title: 'Page Not Found'. Content indicates: Page not found or access denied.
Do not retry - the URL may be invalid or the content may not exist.
```

### For Empty/Minimal Pages
```
‚ùå Page at https://example.com/empty loaded but appears to be empty or broken.
Title: 'Loading...'. Visible text length: 15 chars.
This may indicate a JavaScript-heavy page that failed to load, blocked content, or invalid URL.
Do not retry - consider using web search instead.
```

### For Tracking/Analytics Redirects
```
‚ùå Navigation to https://www.seadoo.com/product was redirected to tracking/analytics service (https://www.googletagmanager.com/...).
This indicates the site is likely blocking automated access or the page doesn't exist.
Do not retry - consider using web search to find the information instead.
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:

```bash
python test_browser_fixes.py
```

This will test various scenarios and confirm that the tool now properly detects and handles broken/empty pages without getting stuck in retry loops.

## Impact

- **Prevents infinite loops** when URLs don't contain the expected content
- **Faster failure detection** saves time and resources
- **Clearer error messages** help agents make better decisions
- **Maintains functionality** for valid pages while adding robustness for edge cases
